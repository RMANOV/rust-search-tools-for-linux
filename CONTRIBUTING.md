# 🤝 Contributing to Rust Search Tools

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the fastest search tools on Linux! Every contribution, no matter how small, helps make Linux faster for everyone.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-search-tools-for-linux
cd rust-search-tools-for-linux

# Set up development environment
cargo build
cargo test
```

## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Bug Reports
- Use GitHub Issues with detailed reproduction steps
- Include system info (OS, Rust version, hardware)
- Provide benchmark data when possible

### ⚡ Performance Improvements
- Profile your changes with `cargo bench`
- Document performance gains with before/after metrics
- Include reasoning for algorithmic choices

### 🧪 New Features
- Discuss major features in GitHub Discussions first
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Add comprehensive tests and documentation

### 📚 Documentation
- Improve README, code comments, examples
- Add usage tutorials and best practices
- Translate to other languages

## 🏗️ Development Workflow

### 1. Code Style
```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run linter
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Run tests
cargo test --all
```

### 2. Performance Testing
```bash
# Build optimized version
cargo build --release

# Run benchmarks
cargo run --release --bin benchmark

# Compare with system tools
./scripts/compare_performance.sh
```

### 3. Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
- `feat: add SIMD optimization for pattern matching`
- `fix: memory leak in file processor`
- `perf: 15% speedup in directory traversal`
- `docs: add usage examples for fgrep`

## 🎯 Areas We Need Help With

### 🔥 High Priority
- [ ] ARM NEON SIMD optimizations
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] MacOS benchmarking
- [ ] Memory usage optimizations

### 🚀 Medium Priority  
- [ ] Plugin system architecture
- [ ] GUI frontend (Tauri/Electron)
- [ ] Container image optimizations
- [ ] Network filesystem support

### 💡 Ideas Welcome
- [ ] Machine learning for search prediction
- [ ] Integration with popular editors
- [ ] Cloud storage backends
- [ ] Advanced filtering capabilities

## 🧪 Testing

We maintain high code quality through comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test

# Integration tests
cargo test --test integration

# Property-based tests (fuzzing)
cargo test --features=fuzzing

# Performance regression tests
cargo test --release --features=benchmarks
```

## 📊 Performance Standards

All performance improvements must be:
- **Measurable**: Include benchmark data
- **Reproducible**: Work across different systems
- **Documented**: Explain the optimization
- **Tested**: No performance regressions

## 🔒 Security

Security is paramount:
- No unsafe code without thorough justification
- Memory safety guaranteed by Rust's type system
- Input validation for all user data
- Audit dependencies regularly

## 💬 Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: Architecture discussions
- **Discord**: Real-time chat and help
- **Email**: Security issues and sensitive topics

## 🎨 Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other:
- Respectful and inclusive communication
- Constructive feedback and reviews
- Help newcomers learn and contribute
- Celebrate diverse perspectives and ideas

## 🏆 Recognition

Contributors are recognized through:
- GitHub contributors graph
- Release notes acknowledgments
- Hall of Fame in README
- Special badges for significant contributions

## 📋 Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting:
- [ ] Tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
